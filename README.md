# CDI-Capstone
California Dream Index Capstone Project

This is a two-part data science project performed by NYU CUSP teammates Michael Carper and Aren Kabarajian in collaboration with the sponsor, California Forward Sr. Research Analyst Patrick Atwater, as well as NYU mentor Dr. Eric Corbett.

The first phase of this project resulted in interactive map visualizatons of the state of California, depicting scores of ten different indicators of economic mobility, as well as a composite score (the CDI score).

The second phase of this project was a series of clustering analyses on California residents using these same indicators as features. The first clustering exercise was only for the year 2019 and was based on the eight indicators that were available in the IPUMS census microdata archives. Seven clusters were produced and compared here, and this is titled the 2019 Comprehensive Clustering. The second exercise involved analyses for each decade from 1990 to 2019 and relied on three of the indicators as features due to availability in the data. Four clusters were produced for each decade and compared. This exercise is referred to as the Multi-Year Clustering.
